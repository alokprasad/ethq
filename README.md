EthQ
====

Displays an auto-updating per-second count of the number of packets
and bytes being handled by each queue on a multi-queue NIC.

Usage: `ethq [-t] <interface>`.

With `-t` specified the display just scrolls on the terminal, otherwise
it runs in an auto-refreshing window.

Requirements
------------

This software only runs on Linux.  It requires a C++11 compiler and
the NCurses library.

NIC Support
-----------

The format of the names of the statistics values from a NIC is highly
driver specific.

The code currently supports the stats generated by the Intel `igb`,
`ixgbe` and `i40e` drivers, and the VMware `vmxnet3` driver.

To request support for additional NICs, raise a github issue and
include the output of `ethtool -i` and `ethtool -S` for your interface.
