EthQ
====

Displays an auto-updating per-second count of the number of packets
and bytes being handled by each queue on a multi-queue NIC.

Usage: `ethq <interface>`.

Requirements
------------

This software only runs on Linux.  It requires a C++11 compiler, the
NCurses library and the C++ bindings for NCurses.

The format of the names of the statistics values from a NIC is highly
driver specific.

The code currently supports the stats generated by the Intel `ixgbe`
and `i40e` drivers, and the VMware `vmxnet3` driver.
